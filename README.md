### Executive Summary
This project is meant to be an initial look at the relationship of education and income in Davidson County to gain insight in overcoming poverty. I have a long term goal of philanthropy and this project is to further my knowledge for that journey. I will begin by exploring data from Metro Nashville Public Schools as well as TN Department of Education data. I plan to use Python to explore and clean my data then use Tableau for data visualization. This is a complex issue that will not likely be solved by this analysis alone but it will be a foundational step in that direction.

### Motivation
I have worked to overcome the poverty I grew up seeing in my community and have a future goal of helping others to overcome poverty. This project is to utilize the data analysis skills I have acquired while at Nashville Software School (NSS) to begin exploring what my role is in giving back to others in need.

### Data Question
What high schools in MNPS have a high proportion of students who are economically disadvantaged? Do students who are economically disadvantaged perform at a lower level academically compared to their non-economically disadvantaged classmates? How can we help these high school students who are economically disadvantaged to better themselves and overcome hardships they may have encountered growing up within their families and/or communites?
